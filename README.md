dnd tools

This was a fun personal project to learn Python, but it has come in handy as a 
companion app of sorts for my online DnD groups using Roll 20. 

Here are some of the use cases that I have found useful.
- DM tells the group how much coin was found in that chest. Great! 
  This app will split it up and tell you how much each player can add to their character sheet
- You have a ton of lower end currency - The app will automatically upconvert all of it
  and also optionally keep gold or upgrade to plat.
- It will provide a leveling chart, our group frequently found ourselves
  Googling the level chart.
- This app will provide you with random fantasy names for Male and Female characters.
  I was not very good at picking names for NPCs when my DM would ask, hence the option.
- The app will roll dice as well. This was not something that was necessarily needed
  to add functionality to Roll 20, but it was something that I wanted to do for the 
  learning process and to try out regex. The usage is fairly self-explainatory.
